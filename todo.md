- [x] compile it to a standalone and check the nREPL server
  - [x] compile
- [x] wasm
  - [x] compile
  - [x] source mapping to cpp
  - [x] source mapping to jank
  - [x] cpp/raw
- [x] cpp integration
  - [x] :as
  - [x] :refer
  - [x] autocompletion
  - [x] if a function has a docstring, can we show it?
- [x] add flecs to something as a test
  - [x] include
    - (cpp/raw "#include <flecs.h>")
  - [x] call `ecs_init`
  - [x] static

    - [x] (require '["flecs.h" :as fw :scope "flecs.world"])
- [ ] wasm
  - [x] no require
  - [ ] with require (do the AOT instead of JIT when generating code for WASM)
  - [ ] export symbols automatically using malli schema-like format
- [ ] Fix `This function is returning a native object of type 'flecs::world', which is not convertible to a jank runtime object.`
- [ ] Fix implicit conversion
  - Unknown implicit conversion from ecs_world_t * to jank::runtime::object *. {:jank/error-kind "internal/analysis-failure" :jank/error-message "Unknown implicit conversion from ecs_world_t * to jank::runtime::object *."}
- [ ] fix tests at `./bin/compile && bin/jank/compiler+runtime/bash_test.clj > grep -v "missing from root"`
- [ ] use it to hotreload in SC
  - [x] dylib from SC
  - [x] ability to export symbol from jank
  - [x] ability to receive, return pointers
  - [-] test dynamic symbol
  - [ ] call my_multiplier
    - [ ] create a way to read/parse plugin_interface, making it available into jank
- [ ] create a way to autocomplete `cpp/` (static gathering? at least for core)
  - [x] get globals defined from cpp/raw
  - [x] list globals in nREPL
  - [ ] get existing globals ?
- [ ] accept/return structs ?
- [ ] combine the entities in the root level namespaces (and the functions without a ns)
  - functions, namespaces
  - [ ] gather
  - [ ] complain if trying to use something ambiguous (e.g. aliasing or refering to a fn that has the same name in 2 namespaces)
- [ ] vybe
- [ ] jank bootstrapping
