; Test that re-evaluating ns form works when namespace defines a var
; that shadows clojure.core (e.g., 'time'). Previously this would fail
; because refer tried to map clojure.core/time but 'time' was already
; mapped to the local namespace's var.

(ns test.ns.shadow)

; Define a function that shadows clojure.core/time
(defn time [x] (* x 2))

; Re-evaluate the ns form - this should NOT fail
(ns test.ns.shadow)

; Verify our local 'time' function still works
(if (= (time 21) 42)
  :success
  (throw (ex-info "shadowed var not preserved" {})))
